# 1 - About this project
This is a project based on the Nucleo-F429ZI microcontroller board and the SVM30 sensor module. The programming language is C. The aim is to capture several environmental parameters, and send them through the Ethernet to a data-logging system/computer.

- Tasks
  - Sensor measures: Temprature, Relative Humidity(RH), Carbon Dioxide equivalent(CO2eq) and Total Volatile Organic Compounds(TVOC).
  - Board processes raw data to get calculated, readable values.
  - Board transmit data through the UDP protocol to a designated IP address.

- Additional features
  - Dedicated sensor library
  - Sleep mode for board -> active only during a defined, recurring period of data capture, calculation, and transmission
  - Real-time data visualization -> Matlab script
  - Network packet capture -> Wireshark

# 5 - Software setup
 | Method 1 - Complete package |  |
 | ------ | ------ |
 | Step 1 | Extract Clean_UDP_Remote.rar |
 | Step 2 | Import project to CubeIDE |
 | Step 3 | Connect board and run program |

 | Method 2 - Essential files |  |
 | ------ | ------ |
 | Step 1 | Create a new Nucleo-F429ZI project on CubeIDE |
 | Step 2 | Put all essential files into their respective folders according to 8 - Folder Structure |
 | Step 3 | Open .ioc file and generate code through CubeMX |
 | Step 4 | Connect board and run program |

# 6 - Code & Settings

*Below are settings that could be tweaked to quickly adapt to different setup environments. For full settings, please check the files.

- Clock settings - Clean_UDP_Remote.ioc
<img src="Images/clock settings.png" width="200" />

- Network settings - Clean_UDP_Remote.ioc
<img src="Images/network settings.png" width="500" />

- Packet message settings
  - main.c
  - All four measurements are sent in one single packet as char. strings.
  - Modify measurement string separators in sprintf() in void doTasks(struct pbuf *pbufPtr), 

# 7 - Operation
 | Start |  |
 | ------ | ------ |
 | Step 1 | Turn on board power supply |
 | Step 2 | Wait for >15s |
 | Step 3 | Alternating blue and red LED -> board is now capturing and sending data |

 | Monitoring |  |
 | ------ | ------ |
 | Data update | Outgoing/Incoming measurement data every 1s |
 | Matlab script | Automatically shows live plots and saves data to a matrix type |
 | Wireshark | Enter "ip.addr == 10.183.93.46" into filter to display packets from the board |

 | End of program |  |
 | ------ | ------ |
 | Board turn-off | Directly turn off power source |

# 8 - Known issues
 - I2C pin mismatch
   - After every code generation from editing the .ioc file
   - Need to change GPIO_PIN_6 to GPIO_PIN_8 in i2c configurarion file (e.g. i2c.c or main.c)
 - Matlab script performance 
   - After some amount of date accumulation
   - Very slow figure zoom-in and zoom-out
